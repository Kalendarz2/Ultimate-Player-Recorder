# Ultimate Player Recorder
The most advanced player recording datapack. Allows you to record an infinite number of long animations without tickrate drops, play multiple coordinated animations at once, record destroyed and placed blocks, change multiple animation settings, modify all previously recorded actions using a powerfull editor, and much more.

## How to use
To start recording, use the ``/trigger record`` command or ``/trigger menu`` to access all the features of the datapack. To execute an animation, get it as an item and throw it at the selected entity, or give it an ``animation`` scoreboard equivalent to the id of your animation. An ongoing animation can be stopped by giving the ``stop`` tag, and ended by setting the scoreboard to 0. If you don't use the API, you should remove the ``MovementRecord`` datapack after completing your map. Detailed instructions on how to use all modules can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Kalendarz2/Ultimate-Player-Recorder/wiki) tab.

**Currently, the datapack does not work on modified servers, such as Spigot, or Paper.**

## Credit

**In most cases, you don't have to credit me or this datapacks in any way.**

However, if you use it on a Minecraft Realms exclusive map or make significant changes to the datapacks,
such as merging MovementPlay with your other commands, or making it unrecognizable, you should put
a download link to this datapack somewhere on your map/in your datapack.
