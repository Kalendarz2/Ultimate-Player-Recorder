In most cases, you don't have to credit me or this datapacks in any way.

However, if you use it on a Minecraft Realms exclusive map or make significant changes to the datapacks,
such as merging MovementPlay with your other commands, or making it unrecognizable, you should put
a download link to this datapack somewhere on your map/in your datapack.
